### The first  forum for newcomers to ML is co-located with NeurIPS, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Monday, December 9th, 2019.

# Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are organizing this special New in ML workshop, co-locating with NeurIPS 2019. We are targeting anyone who has not published a paper at the NeurIPS main conference yet. We invited top NeurIPS researchers to review your work and share with you their experience in poster sessions and mentoring sessions. The best papers will get oral presentations and even awards!

Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at next year's NeurIPS conference, and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!  

# Call For Papers

Your ticket to NeurIPS 2020? Maybe!

Since this is an exercise in writing good NeurIPS papers, the authors are requested to submit papers respecting the NeurIPS format and instructions: [https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForPapers](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForPapers). **The page limit is 8 pages + extra references, but shorter papers with enough good contents are welcome.** We restrict submissions to first authors with no prior accepted publication at NeurIPS (main conference) and which are **not under review or accepted elsewhere**. Papers having been rejected before should be revised before submission to New In ML. We recommend sharing previous reviews with your new reviewers.

All topics related to machine learning are welcome. They include but not limited to:
- Adversarial Machine Learning
- Automated Machine Learning
- Bayesian Machine Learning
- Causal Inference
- Deep Learning Theory
- Deep Learning Interpretability
- Fairness and Differential Privacy
- Graph Neural Networks
- Meta Learning
- Reinforcement Learning


Paper submission is through CMT platform: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NewInML2019](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NewInML2019)

Accepted papers will be reviewed by expert NeurIPS reviewers and, if accepted, will get a talk or a poster at the workshop and expect coaching. <b> This will NOT count as an official NeurIPS publication, so papers submitted can then be revised and submitted to NeurIPS 2020, but you should check the policy of other conferences if you want to re-submit elsewhere.</b>

# Best Paper Awards

- Most Disruptive Idea
- Best Scientific Contents
- Best Oral Presentation

# Important Dates

- October 15th, 2019 (Anywhere on Earth): Paper submission deadline
- Nov 8th, 2019: Author notification deadline (**Update: Oral decisions are made. We just finished the notification for oral presentations. There are poster accepted papers to be notified next week. Please stay tuned.**)

- December 09th, 2019: Session day

Within quota limits, the authors of the best accepted papers will be receiving the possibility of registering to NeurIPS and will be able to apply for travel awards, to be attributed according to merit and need.
