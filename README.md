### The first  forum for newcomers to ML is co-located with NeurIPS, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Monday, December 9th, 2019.

# Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are organizing this special New in ML workshop, co-locating with NeurIPS 2019. We are targeting anyone who has not published a paper at the NeurIPS main conference yet. We invited top NeurIPS researchers to review your work and share with you their experience in poster sessions and mentoring sessions. The best papers will get oral presentations and even awards!

Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at next year's NeurIPS conference, and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!  

# Call For Papers

Your ticket to NeurIPS 2020? Maybe!

Since this is an exercise in writing good NeurIPS papers, the authors are requested to submit papers respecting the NeurIPS format and instructions: [https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForPapers](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForPapers). We welcome submissions by first authors with no prior accepted publication at NeurIPS (main conference).

All topics related to machine learning are welcome. They include but not limited to:
- Automated Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Meta Learning
- Graph Neural Networks
- Adversarial Machine Learning
- Deep Learning Theory
- Deep Learning Interpretability
- Causal Inference
- Fairness and Differential Privacy


Paper submission is through CMT platform: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NewInML2019](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NewInML2019)

Accepted papers will be reviewed by expert NeurIPS reviewers and, if accepted, will get a talk or a poster at the workshop and expect coaching. <b> This will NOT count as an official publication, so papers submitted can then be revised and submitted to NeurIPS 2020! </b>
