### The first  forum for newcomers to ML is co-located with NeurIPS, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Monday, December 9th, 2019.

# Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing up the ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are organizing this special New in ML workshop, co-locating with NeurIPS 2019. We are targeting anyone who hasn't published a paper at NeurIPS conference track and we want to try our best to help you! We will invite acknowledged researchers to share with you their suggestions; we are providing opportunities to have your on-going projects reviewed by senior reviewers and even mentored by them; we invite  junior researchers to orally present their innovative work, etc.

Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers in next year's NeurIPS conference, involve fully in this community and benefit the most!
